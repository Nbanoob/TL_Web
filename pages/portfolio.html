                Zombie Cartastrophe is a game where the player takes control of a weaponized car and has to defeat waves of zombies.
                The player gets money for killing zombies and can spend that money on the store to upgrade their arsenal.
                The game was made with a game engine called Construct 2 and with a team of 3 people, including myself.<br/>
                <br/>
                Lead developer of the project. Mainly contributed to the technical side of the game and not the creative side. The game was created in 2016.

                In-Development Discord Bot
            </p>
            <p style="color:#f2eee0; font-size:20pt; text-align: center" class="animated fadeIn delay-1s">
                Over the summer, I picked up learning how to develop a bot for the communication platform Discord. It started out as a joke
                between friends, but it quickly developed into a genuine interest of the Discord API that I used to create the bot. The bot currently
                has a lot of inside jokes and is very basic, but the most practical uses of the bot is that it can delete messages, whether it be its own
                or others. It can distinguish between its own messages and others to know what to delete.<br/>
                <br/>
                I plan to add more features to the bot so that it can be a more focused bot. As it stands, it doesn't serve much of a purpose other than
                being a little entertaining for my friends and I.

                Planned Minecraft Mod
            </p>
            <p style="color:#f2eee0; font-size:20pt; text-align: center" class="animated fadeIn delay-1s">
                I plan to start development on a Minecraft mod for a few reasons. The first reason being that I simply love the game. It opens up a lot of opportunities for creativity
                but at the same time, it offers a multitude of different ways to play for everyone to enjoy. I've enjoy Minecraft a lot more thanks to mods and I wanted
                to give it a try to not only improve my own programming skills, but to see if I can improve the Minecraft experience for others. The second reason is that I've
                been only learning Java in my classes. I've become very proficient in Java and so I figured why not use that profiency on a game that is built solely on Java.
